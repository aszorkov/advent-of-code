# Advent of code!

The year is 2022 and this year I've decided (a few... or more like 8... days late) to participate in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

In the spirit of #learninginpublic I've decided to commit my solutions to this repo. For the year 2022, I've decided that this is a great opportunity for me to do something I've been putting off for too long, which is to learn Python. As such, don't expect any of my solutions to be elegant or optimal.
